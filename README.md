# go_lcs
learning classifier system in go

June 22, 2017 Hmmm. js-lcs was locking up. I don't know why. (Maybe because of the solstice).
So I decided to re-write in go.

June 29, 2017 Continue to work on Go. Put in GA 
Now must test

January 29, 2018 - After a hiatus am now back to XCS and learning classifier systems.
